Note that this code was unfinished at the time I stopped working on it, and required
patches to Gstreamer to get resonable results,

(The code in that area of Gstreamer has since changed though.)

Install and run on Ubuntu 14.04
-------------------------------

Install dependancies:

  sudo aptitude install ruby2.0-dev ruby-gir-ffi gir1.2-gst-plugins-base-1.0


Run:

  ruby2.0 main.rb



Listen to the resulting stream:

Includes a waveform view and timestamps since playback started (not AES67-style though),

  gst-launch-1.0 udpsrc port=5004 caps='application/x-rtp,media=audio,clock-rate=48000,encoding-name=L24,encoding-params=2,channels=2,payload=96' \
	! rtpjitterbuffer ! rtpL24depay ! audio/x-raw,rate=48000 \
	! tee name=t ! queue ! autoaudiosink t. ! audioconvert \
	! wavescope ! videoconvert ! timeoverlay ! ximagesink
